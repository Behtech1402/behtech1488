        ??? What is electronics?
     </h2>
     <p style="color: darkslategrey; font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
         Electronics in simple language:
         <br>
         Electronics is the study and use of electrical devices that control the flow of electrons
         or other electrically charged particles work in devices such as vacuum lamps and semiconductors
<br>
A little more complicated:
<br>
It refers to a wide range of electricity that deals with the movement of electrons in a variety of semiconductor circuits.
<br>
IC. Inventions have caused a lot of changes in this science and created modern electronic systems, including remote control circuits, space satellites, robots, etc.

      There are many electronic components that are used to make electronic circuits. Circuits are never complete or perform well without these electronic components. These electronic components include resistors, diodes, capacitors, integrated circuits, etc. Some of these parts consist of two or more terminals that are soldered to the circuit board. Some may be in the form of integrated circuits or ICs in which various semiconductor components are integrated. In this article from Faradars magazine, we will have an overview of each of these electronic components and equipment used in electronics.
      The design of an electronic circuit should consider the following:

      Main electronic parts: capacitors, resistors, diodes, transistors and...
      Power sources: signal generators and DC power supply.
      Measurement and analysis tools: cathode ray oscilloscope (CRO), multimeter, etc.

        Monetization of electronics
    </h5>
    <p style="color: darkslategrey;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
        Finding out the average salary for different job groups, such as the salary of a power engineer or the salary of an electronics major, has always been a concern of job seekers and employers. Job seekers tend to know the average salary in their job, to make sure their salary is fair, and employers can pay him the right amount for hiring electrical engineers.
        Expert level: According to this report, the average income of an electrical engineer in 1400 in Tehran was about 6.5 million tomans, and the lowest amount in this job level was 3.5 million tomans and the highest amount was 12.6 million tomans. It is also predicted that the average salary of an electrical engineer will reach 8.4 million Tomans in 2011. The lowest requested amount in the electrical occupation group in 1401 is about 4.6 million Tomans and the highest expected amount is 16.1 million Tomans.

Master's level: Electrical engineers who have more work experience and have reached the master's level receive higher salaries and expect higher salary increases in 1401. The average monthly income of electrical engineers at the master's level in 1400 was about 8.5 million tomans, and these people expect their income to reach 11 million tomans per month in 1401.

Manager level: Electrical engineers who have reached the managerial level with years of work experience received an average of 11 million Tomans per month in 1400. These experts expect their monthly income to reach 13.8 million tomans in 1401.

    It is a science that includes physics, engineering, technology and applications that deals with the flow and control of electrons in vacuum and matter. In electronics, active amplification and rectification devices are used to control the flow of electrons, while in classical electrical engineering passive effects such as resistance, Capacitor and inductor are used to control the flow of electricity.
